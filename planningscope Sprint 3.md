## Sprint 3 Planning Scope

### Goals

1. **Implement Basic Security**:
   - Add user authentication and authorization.
   - Implement secure password storage.
   - Document the security measures implemented.

2. **ACID Transactions**:
   - Implement transactions to ensure data integrity.
   - Ensure that all CRUD operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
   - Document the transaction management and examples.

### Tasks

1. **Basic Security**:
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., login, registration) with secure password hashing (using libraries like bcrypt).
   - Set up user roles and permissions for different database operations.
   - Secure the application against SQL injection attacks by using prepared statements.
   - Document the security implementation, including code snippets and explanations.

2. **ACID Transactions**:
   - Implement transactions in the MySQL database for complex operations.
   - Ensure that all CRUD operations are wrapped in transactions where necessary.
   - Test transactions to ensure they meet ACID properties.
   - Provide examples of transaction management (e.g., transferring funds between accounts).
   - Document the transaction handling with examples and explanations.

### Timeline

- **Week 1**:
  - Implement user authentication and authorization.
  - Secure password storage and protect against SQL injection.
  - Begin documentation of security measures.

- **Week 2**:
  - Implement ACID transactions for complex operations.
  - Test and verify transaction management.
  - Complete documentation for transactions and security.

By following this plan, you will be able to achieve the objectives for Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, ensuring your project is well-structured, secure, and adheres to database best practices. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
