# Sprint 3 Planning Scope

## Goals

1. **Implement Sub-Queries**:
   - Write and test sub-queries for data analysis.

2. **Create and Optimize Indexes**:
   - Implement indexes to improve query performance.
   - Analyze and optimize query performance.

3. **Set Up User Privileges**:
   - Implement user privileges to control access to the database.

4. **Create and Utilize Views**:
   - Create views to simplify complex queries.

5. **Implement ACID Transactions**:
   - Ensure all CRUD operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.

## Tasks

1. **Sub-Queries**:
   - Write sub-queries to retrieve specific subsets of data.
   - Test sub-queries on the MySQL database to ensure they return expected results.
   - Document each sub-query with its purpose and results.

2. **Indexes**:
   - Create indexes on frequently queried columns to improve performance.
   - Analyze query performance before and after indexing.
   - Optimize any slow-running queries using the created indexes.
   - Document the indexing strategy and performance improvements.

3. **User Privileges**:
   - Define different user roles and assign appropriate privileges.
   - Implement and test user privileges to ensure controlled access.
   - Document the privileges assigned to each role.

4. **Views**:
   - Create views to encapsulate complex queries and simplify data access.
   - Test the views to ensure they return correct and expected results.
   - Document the created views and their purposes.

5. **ACID Transactions**:
   - Implement transactions for complex CRUD operations.
   - Ensure that all CRUD operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable.
   - Test transactions to verify they meet ACID properties.
   - Document transaction management with examples and explanations.

## Success Criteria

- Successfully written and tested sub-queries with accurate results.
- Indexes are created and query performance is optimized.
- User privileges are correctly assigned and verified.
- Views are created and functioning as intended.
- Transactions are implemented and tested, ensuring they meet ACID properties.
- Comprehensive documentation covering sub-queries, indexes, privileges, views, and transactions.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**:
  - Write and test sub-queries.
  - Implement indexes and analyze query performance.
  - Define user roles and set up privileges.
  - Begin creating views to simplify complex queries.

- **Week 2**:
  - Implement and test ACID transactions.
  - Finalize and verify all tasks from Week 1.
  - Complete documentation for sub-queries, indexes, privileges, views, and transactions.
  - Prepare the final submission for Sprint 3.
